    "TF-IDF is an approach for representing text that involves the product of two components, term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF). The term frequency is determined by dividing the number of occurrences of a specific word in a sentence by the total number of words in that sentence. The inverse document frequency is calculated by taking the logarithm of the total number of sentences in the corpus divided by the number of sentences that contain the specific word. The resulting TF-IDF score is obtained by multiplying the TF and IDF values for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of TF-IDF over other text representation techniques, such as the bag of words model, is its ability to give an estimation of the semantic meaning of words. While the bag of words model simply represents words as binary values (either present or absent), TF-IDF scores indicate the relative importance of words in different sentences by comparing their scores. For example, if a word is present in every sentence of a corpus, its IDF value would be log(1)=0, resulting in a TF-IDF score of 0 for that word, indicating that it does not convey any special meaning in those sentences."
